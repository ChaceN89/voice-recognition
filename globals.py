# a 95% confidence level is less likely to accept the test case compared to a 90% confidence level. Here's why:
# A 95% confidence level corresponds to a larger critical value (approximately 1.96 for a two-tailed test).
# A 90% confidence level corresponds to a smaller critical value (approximately 1.645 for a two-tailed test).
